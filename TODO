iznik code which needs looking at:
- Router is only partial copy
- Scan original main.js
- Scan original pageheader.php

Retired use of lib in favour of NPM packages, with the following exceptions which need reviewing or tidying:
- Combodate is not on NPM - added in src
- jquery-showfirst not on NPM, added in src.  showlast is ours, I think.
- jquery.dd is antiquated and not on npm
- jquery validate has changed a bit, not sure if that's the right npm packes.- check community events etc work.
- backbone.collectionView doesn't appear to be on npm
- backform oddly needs to be backform/src/backform to require ok
- dateshim very old and not on NPM but prob needed in some form
- jquery.waypoints is on NPM but can't require after installing.

Can't load gmaps via require as synchronous in node; need to rework code that does that.
Hacky code in base.js to export the Iznik global - is that right?

Changed webpack.config.dev to provide jQuery - some plugins assume
